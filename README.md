 **About MIC**
 
 This is an android project made by Pratham Khurana for converting person voice into text and having a response back from the Google DialogFlow cusotm trained models which can recognize main Intents and return back found queries. Developer can use those queries to detech the intent and by using those intent can perform different tasks on Android. An great example is as follow:
 
 Clone or download this project and run in Android Studio.
 
 Create custom Models in DialogFlow(https://dialogflow.com/) and get the bearer and session ID.
 
 Implement that ID and bearer into Async.java file.
 
 Open MIC in android phone(ANDORID above Marshmallow(API 21)) and say allow couples of permissions.
 
 Ask something you have feeded in Dealog Flow custom Model.
 
 BOOMMMMMM Here is your Response from that model.
